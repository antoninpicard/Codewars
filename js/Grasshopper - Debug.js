// Debug celsius converter
// Your friend is traveling abroad to the United States so he wrote a program to convert fahrenheit to celsius. Unfortunately his code has some bugs.

// Find the errors in the code to get the celsius converter working properly.

// To convert fahrenheit to celsius:

// celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * (5/9)
// Remember that typically temperatures in the current weather conditions are given in whole numbers. It is possible for temperature sensors to report temperatures with a higher accuracy such as to the nearest tenth. Instrument error though makes this sort of accuracy unreliable for many types of temperature measuring sensors.

function weatherInfo (temp) {
    var c = convertToCelsius(temp)
    if (c < 0)
      return (c + " is freezing temperature")
    else
      return (c + " is above freezing temperature")
  }
  
  function convertToCelsius (temperature) {
    var celsius = (temperature - 32) * (5/9)
    return celsius
  }
