# Description:
# Remove an exclamation mark from the end of a string. For a beginner kata, you can assume that the input data is always a string, no need to verify it.

# Examples
# remove("Hi!") == "Hi"
# remove("Hi!!!") == "Hi!!"
# remove("!Hi") == "!Hi"
# remove("!Hi!") == "!Hi"
# remove("Hi! Hi!") == "Hi! Hi"
# remove("Hi") == "Hi"
